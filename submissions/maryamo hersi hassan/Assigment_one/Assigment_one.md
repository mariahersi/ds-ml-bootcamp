# Machine Learning: An Overview with Concepts and Real-World Application

## What Is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following fixed rules, ML systems identify patterns from experience and use them to make predictions or decisions.

## Real-Life Example: Email Spam Filtering

Email services analyze thousands of emails labeled as spam or not spam. From this data, the system learns patterns such as keywords, sender behavior, and message structure, improving its accuracy over time.

## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data to predict outcomes, while unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns.

## Overfitting

Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data because it learns noise instead of general patterns.

## Training and Test Data

Data is split into training and test sets to evaluate how well a model generalizes to new data. A common split is 80% training and 20% testing.

## Case Study: Machine Learning in Healthcare

A deep learning system was used to detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images, achieving accuracy comparable to medical specialists.
